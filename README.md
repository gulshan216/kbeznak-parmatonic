kbeznak parmatonic is a new project that i am working on for my CSCE670 Information Storage and Retrieval class.
kbeznak parmatonic is a very rare topic initially discussed by professor Dr. James Caverlee in his class at Texas A&M University(TAMU).  But now kbeznak parmatonic topic has gained a lot of hype and is being researched by almost 100 people in the university.

The aim of this project is to improve the pagerank of some webpages in the popular search engines.Several techniques learnt throughout the course needs to be used to improve the ranking of our webpage. The techniques are required to be ethical though.
